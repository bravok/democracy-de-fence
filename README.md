# Democracy DeFence is a Peaceful protest of violent attacks on democracy.

This protest format serves the following purposes

1) Show that there are more people in support of our government representatives and institutions than against them.

2) Acknowlege the need for distance between people during the current pandemic.

3) As an effort against violence, spread the protestors out in case of violence against some of them, so that others are not easily injured as well

4) Form a physical barrier against people attempting to storm a government building

5) Visually powerful, with each fence painted with the messaging of a sign

6) Defensive. Fencing is heavy, and not readily usable as a weapon by the average person. So... still peaceful

7) Not as much need to shout and chant - the fence speaks volumes

8) As sections are overrun they create obstructions on the ground to slow advancing mobs

9) Rows of Defence get stronger as you retreat - more people defending each subsequent row, as the retreating line doubles up on the next line

10) Create a very strong barrier from average citizens

## Instructions

1) Get some wood or a section of existing fence

2) Create a section about two to three people wide

3) Attach a vertical piece of wood behind it with a hinge. This will be your prop to help you hold the fence up. A Narrow Defence may need a board across the bottom of the prop to make it stable

4) Paint it and write your protest message on it

5) Strap it to the top of your automobile

6) Show up and defend Democracy

## How to use it.

1) Line up along an agreed upon protest line

2) Prop your fence up in place, next to other fences. Overlapping a bit helps

2.1) If the protest line is already fully fenced, make a new line behind it

3) Stand behind your fence and help keep the line

4) If you are attacked, wedge your foot behind the prop to help keep your fence in place

5) If the attack is too forceful, leave your fence in place and walk behind the next row behind you

6) If you are in the line behind the one attacked, shift your fence to let the first line past

7) Hold the next line together. It should be stronger with more people now, and there should be a debris pile of the first line of fence, making it harder for the counter-protest to attack you

## Important Notes

Make your fence strong. Make it hard for others to take it apart and use as a weapon. Wrapping rope around and through it will help this

Don't attack. This is for peaceful protesting in defence of democracy

Don't antagonize - let the counter-democracy group do all the work

## Reuse

Part of a twin bed foundation broken into top and bottom makes a good Defence

Pallet wood is also good for making a Defence
